# Computer on a Chip: open source silicon clone of Atari 2600 / VCS

Goal of this project is to create a **complete computer** on a single silicon chip using only Free and Open Source (FOSS) tools and Open Source PDK.

Atari 2600 fits this goal perfectly thanks to it is minimal hardware design (i.e. only 128 bytes of RAM) while sporting a large software library!

## Brief overview of the Atari 2600
The [Atari 2600](https://www.atariage.com/2600/) is a second generation home video game console, originally called Atari VCS was released in September 1977. It consists of just 3 chips:
1) Main CPU - MOS Technology 6502 clocked at 1.193182 MHz.
2) Video & Audio chip - Television Interface Adaptor (TIA) clocked 3 times faster than CPU at 3.579545 MHz. Produces NTSC video signal and 2 audio channels.
3) RAM, I/O and Timer in a single package - MOS Technology 6532 also known as RIOT includes 128 bytes of memory.

Unique aspects that make Atari 2600 suitable to fit on a tiny piece of silicon:
1) Console had no framebuffer. Graphics are generated by ["racing the beam"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racing_the_Beam) technique.
2) Only 128 bytes of RAM.
3) All games code and data are completely external to the system and are situated on a pluggable ROM cartridge. Roughly 1 MB/s of memory bandwidth.
4) Relatively low design complexity totaling in approximately 15K tranistors: 4528 (CPU), 6193 (TIA), ~5000 (RIOT).
5) Original designs are well studied and schematics are known down to a single transistor.

## Implementation overview

This design is based on Lawrie Griffiths' [FPGA version of Atari 2600](https://github.com/lawrie/ulx3s_atari_2600) with the following modifications:
- Arlet Ottens' [6502](https://github.com/Arlet/verilog-6502) version of the CPU core
- a single clock domain for all components
- scanline doubler to convert NTSC 15 kHz to 30 kHz VGA video signal on the fly without introducing a framebuffer
- dithering to approximate 128 colors over the 6 bit-per-pixel [TinyVGA PMOD](https://github.com/mole99/tiny-vga)
- QSPI to access cartridge ROMs stored on external Flash
- fixes to TIA and PIA (I/O & Timer part of the RIOT) chips
- only NTSC is supported

Modifications to Arlet's 6502 core:
- reset cycle bug fixes such as writes enabled while address bus is still in undefined state
- reset cycle explicit register initialisation because unlike FPGAs real silicon can not just set default values
